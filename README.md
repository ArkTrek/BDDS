# Brain Disease Detection System (BDDS)
BDDS is an AI-based system designed to detect six different brain diseases from MRI images. This system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify MRI images into distinct disease categories. It aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve the treatment process for neurological conditions.

## Features
